- **template of:** vite + react + typescript

## Note
```bash
This application was created using React Typescript and SCSS,
In this system, here are a few feature that you could explore:
- Search data based on Komoditas
- Filter data based on Size, Province, City
- Pagination to move, limit, expand page data
- Add Item inside list 
- Caching features handled by \"React Query\"
- Loading mark and Toaster, so you know what is happening on the application 
```

## WHY?????
```bash
I made this app to complete task for my application on eFishery.
some library I used and the reason:
- Vite => bundler that blazingly fast âš¡âš¡âš¡
- React => my comfy UI library I used everyday
- Typescript => type-safe language, I loved this one so you could see error on code editor
- SCSS => I\'m not fan of CSS, I\'m more into TAILWINDCSS ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- React Query => my library I learned this week, so I need a project to implement it 
- react-hot-toast => my favorite notification or toaster, just it 
```
